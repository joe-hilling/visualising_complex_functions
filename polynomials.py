    POLYNOMIALS
    The Factor Theorem says that if a polynomial p(x) has root r, then xâˆ’r divides p(x).
    
    Fundamental theorem says that degree n polynomials have n roots. This allows
    us to equare the polynomial and root views. I.e, a collection of points and 
    a function defined on all the space. Polynomials functions are equivalent 
    to defining set of points (the roots). However finding the roots from a 
    polynomial requires (in general) iteratively searching them out. But if we
    have roots we can easily get to the function.
